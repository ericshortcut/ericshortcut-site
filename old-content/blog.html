         Hi, I'm a developer. You maybe be are one too or maybe are not but any way you've got here. Now I tell you a short story.
         <p>

          <h2>Why do I want to work at Toptal? ( Toptal Web Engineers Group )</h2>
          <p>
            I've been asked to make a blog post explaining why do I want to work at Toptal. It made me think about my entire career and all things I've made to get to this level.
          </p>
          <h3>1# My curiosity about computers & electronics</h3>
          <p>
            It started when I was a kid. Most of my toys where disassembled - and sometimes almost reassembled- because I wanted to understand how they worked. I remember how I felt when I saw a computer for the first time. It was amazing! There were a separated room and it was called "lab" where I studied. Then I thought, It'd be cool if my parents bought one for me! Because I could not afford one for myself - I was 7 years old.- I remember my father making some price research. Deep down inside I knew that he would do anything that he could to give me that computer but he couldn't afford 'cause it was way too expensive at the time, so this was a dead end for me.
          </p>
          <h3>2# Effort</h3>
          <p>
            Some Years have been passing. I started to work as a trainee in a Electric Company, I was 15 years old. Then I bought my first computer a few months later. It was fantastic. I could make my tasks and get organized with spreadsheets. Make electrical circuits in a simulator. Even watch movies on DVD! But I did not have internet connection it took two years more. When you are 15 you don't have much patience. Now I know that not having internet connection was not that bad. (I might be having spent) most of my time on MSN instead of clicking, opening and trying to modify my OS to understand how things work.
          </p>
          <h3>3# Find the right place.</h3>
          <p>
            No much time has been passing. Now 1st December, 2009. My first job in IT working with servers and people with big brains. IBM was a breaktrough. Walking through aisles and hearing people speaking different languages on the same room. I enjoyed it a lot but after a while I was looking for something on development. It was not there. I had some classes at college about web development and I thought that was the right path. So 2012 I started to work with web development, one year later as part-time teacher. Sometimes even freelancing as a mobile developer.
          </p>
          <h3>4# Now 2017, It's time to face new challenges</h3>
          <p>
            I'm looking for the next challenge. I'm working in a company that has great people and I'm again on the comfort zone. I'm the single developer for the applications. Most of the time I'm doing maintenance work - keeping the patient alive - but I want to be back in the development queue, solve issues. I want to see a burn-down chart. I want to share knowledge and being on meetings, working with people all around the world. Creating new software with great architecture. Working in a team.
          </p>

            I think I could finish saying a great phrase from Mr. Roosevelt:
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              In any moment of decision, the best thing you can do is the right thing. The worst thing you can do is nothing.
            <strong>Theodore Roosevelt</strong>
            </p>
